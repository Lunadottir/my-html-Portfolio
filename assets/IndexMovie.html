<h2>A Ranking by Jana-Selina Olsson</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Spirited Away (and other Studio Ghibli Movies)</h3>
<p>I watched this movie many times and recommend it to everyone.</p>
<h3>2. Sherlock Holmes (and other Detective Stories)</h3>
<p>I love movies that require you to think along.</p>
<h3>3. Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings (Big Sagas)</h3>
<p>Diving into big fanatsy worlds is super fun and very nice for a change.</p>
